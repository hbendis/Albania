				<h2 id="text-3">Few Reasons to Visit Albania Right Now!</h2>
				<h5>1. Albanians are SO friendly</h5>
				<p>
					Albanians LOVE foreigners, and nothing makes an Albanian happier than welcoming somebody into their
					country.
					When I was in Albania, people were always desperate to talk to me. They would come up to me at
					markets
					advising me about prices, they would give me their seat on the bus, they would carry my bags and
					just
					generally go out of their way to make sure I was happy and comfortable in their country.

					An old Albanian adage says that ‘An Albanian’s house is the dwelling of God and the guest,’ and for
					this
					reason Albanians will not rest until you are fed, watered and comfortable. What’s more, because
					Albania
					was
					closed to foreigners for so long. Albanians are delighted to see people exploring their country, and
					they
					often can’t believe that people have travelled all the way from Australia (for example) to see
					Albania.
					In 4
					years of full time travel, I have never encountered people as warm and welcoming as the people in
					Albania.
				</p>
				<h5>2. Albania has the best beaches in Europe</h5>
				<p>
					Sorry Spain and Croatia – when it comes to beaches, Albania has it covered, and if that isn’t one of
					the
					best reasons to visit Albania then I don’t know what is! With almost 300 miles of stunning coastline
					and
					white sand beaches, Albania is the best place in Europe if you’re a beach bum, and because Albania
					is
					still
					relatively undiscovered, you won’t struggle to find a place to sunbathe.

					Not only is accommodation on the Albanian Riviera very cheap, but there are also lots of ‘secret’
					beaches
					that you can camp out on – beaches that you’ll only find if you hire a car and do your own road trip
					down
					the coast.
				</p>
				<h5>3. The mountains are equally as beautiful </h5>
				<p>
					If you’re more of a mountain person, then fear not because you will not be disappointed in Albania.

					For fans of hiking then there are also ample hiking trails in Albania, the most popular among
					backpackers
					being the Theth to Valbona hike, open seasonally.

					Fun fact for Harry Potter nerds – Voldemort actually hid out in the Albanian mountains so it’s super
					cool to
					go here as a HP fan and picture He Who Must Not Be Named enjoying the Albanian nature!
				</p>
				<h5>4. The Blue Eye</h5>
				<p>
					Albania’s famous Blue Eye (Syri i Kalter) is a water spring and natural phenomenon that you can’t
					miss
					if
					you visit Albania. More than 50-metres deep (nobody actually knows how deep the Blue Eye is because
					divers
					haven’t been able to reach the bottom), the water in the Blue Eye is so clear that you can see right
					to
					the
					bottom! Surrounded by oak and sycamore trees and a turquoise river, the Blue Eye is an enchanting
					place.

					Just be careful if you decide to go for a swim – the water is freezing!

				<h5 id="text-1">A BRIEF HISTORY OF ALBANIA</h2>
					<h6>Ancient Albania</h6>
					<a href="#">
						<img class="center" width="200" height="169" src="Images/World-Data-Locator-Map-Albania.jpg"
							alt="Jubletta (Xhubleta)">
					</a>
					<p>
						The people of Albania learned to use bronze about 2,100 BC. Then about 1,000 BC they learned to
						use
						iron.
						The iron age people of Albania are called the Illyrians. The Illyrians eventually came into
						conflict
						with
						Rome and the Romans conquered them in 167 BC.
					</p>
					<p>Under Roman rule Albania prospered. The Romans built roads in the area and towns like Elbasani
						grew up.
						However in 395 the Roman Empire split into two parts, East and West. Albania became part of the
						Eastern
						Empire, which is known to us as the Byzantine Empire.

						During the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries Germanic peoples invaded Albania several times but they
						always
						withdrew. Between the invasions life went on as normal.

						Yet because of its position on the edge of the Byzantine Empire Albania was weakly defended.
						In the
						10th
						century the Bulgarians conquered large parts of Albania. However the Byzantines recovered their
						territory in
						the early 11th century when they were led by emperor Basil II.
					</p>
					<h6>Albania in the 20th century</h6>
					<p>
						The nationalist movement promoted Albanian language and culture. Then in 1912 war broke out
						between
						the
						Turks and the Balkan League (Montenegro, Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria). By 1912 the Turkish
						Empire
						was in
						steep decline and Albanians were afraid their country would be divided up between members of the
						Balkan
						League. To prevent that happening Albanian leaders met in Vlora and on 28 November 1912 they
						declared
						independence.
						On 20 December 1912 the European great powers (Britain, France, Germany, Austria and Russia
						recognised
						Albanian independence. In 1913 they appointed a commission to demarcate Albania's borders.
						However,
						they
						refused to recognize the provisional government in Albania. Instead, they made a German prince,
						William of
						Wied king of Albania. William arrived in Albania in March 1914. However, he fled after only six
						months in
						September 1914. Albania then split into regions without any central government.
						However in 1918 the Albanians formed a provisional government. Elections were held and a
						parliament
						sat in
						Tirana in 1920. The Albanian Interior Minister was Ahmet Zogu (1895-1961). In December 1922 he
						became
						Albanian premier. However, Zogu lost the election in January 1924 and he fled abroad in June
						1924.
						Yet in
						December 1924 with Yugoslav help, he marched on Tirana and overthrew the government. Zogu
						quickly
						made
						himself dictator. In 1928 he made himself King Zog of Albania.
					</p>

					<h6>Albania in the 21st Century</h6>
					<p>
						Gradually stability returned to Albania. However since 1998 the Albanian economy has grown
						although
						Albania
						remains a poor country. Today the government is trying to improve infrastructure in Albania.
						Meanwhile in
						2009 Albania joined NATO. Today Albania is hoping to join the EU. Today the population of
						Albania is
						2.9
						million.

				<h6 id="text-1">Albanian clothing</h6>
				<p>Traditional Albanian clothing (Albanian: veshjet tradicionale shqiptare, veshjet kombëtare, veshjet
					popullore
					or kostumet kombëtare) includes more than 200 different kind of clothings in all Albania and
					Albanian
					inhabited lands. This is due to the division the Albanian principalities in the Middle Ages. Almost
					every
					region in Albania has its own traditional dress with women clothing being particularly colorful and
					rich in
					detail. Fabrics are traditionally made by weaving clothes using looms. To this day, some
					conservative old
					men and women mainly from the North wear traditional clothing in their daily lives. Instead, older
					women
					from the South usually wear all-black outfits.</p>
